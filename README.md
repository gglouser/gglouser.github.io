# Grant's Little Projects

I'm Grant Glouser, and these are the little projects I've put on GitHub.

## [Cut and Project Tiling](https://github.com/gglouser/cut-and-project-tiling)

[This interactive applet](https://gglouser.github.io/cut-and-project-tiling) draws Penrose tilings using the pentagrid method or the cut-and-project method, which come from viewing the tiling as a specific slice of a five-dimensional square lattice. These methods are generalized to draw any slice of an any-dimensional square lattice.

[Javascript, Rust wasm]

## Advent of Code Visualizations

I love [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com)!
My solution repos for all years are available.

In 2018, I created simple interactive visualizations for a couple of the days. Both of these days had large input data with a recursive structure, and I thought they could look interesting drawn in the manner of an L-system.

- Day 5: [Polymer Wreath](https://gglouser.github.io/advent2018/visualizations/day05.html)

## [brainfree](https://github.com/gglouser/brainfree)

A brainf*ck interpreter in Haskell. It represents the program using a free monad and offers multiple "back ends" to evaluate it. Also does some simple optimizations.

## [Jump Game plugin](https://github.com/gglouser/JumpGamePlugin)

This is an old Bukkit (Minecraft server) plugin that runs a simple minigame.
