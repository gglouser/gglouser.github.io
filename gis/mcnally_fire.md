# Burn Severity and Land Cover Transition in the McNally Fire

Remote sensing techniques can be used to estimate burn severity in areas affected by wildfires.
The Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) is a radiometric measure of burn severity that was developed
specifically to be calculated from Landsat TM image data.[^1] One way that we might evaluate
whether NBR accurately measures burn severity is to look at patterns of regrowth after a fire
and see whether low severity areas perform differently than high severity areas. To test this
approach, I looked at the McNally Fire, which burned 150,000 acres of Sequoia National Forest
in 2002.
