# Fire perimeter estimation: Atlas Fire 2017

How much land was burned in the 2017 Atlas Fire? This was one of the fourteen large wildfires in
Northern California in October 2017. For this project, I developed a method to determine the fire
perimeter and measure the extent of the damage using the tools in ArcMap. To do this, I first classified
a Landsat 8 image to find fire damaged areas. Then I created a workflow to turn the classified image
into a polygon feature representing the fire perimeter. This workflow was captured as an ArcMap
ModelBuilder model that could be used to apply the same process to other wildfire incidents.
